    ```

3. **Prepare your data**: Ensure you have `training.csv` and `testing.csv` files in the project directory.

## Models Overview

### Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Support Vector Machines (SVM) is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. In this project, SVM is applied to classify handwritten digits. The SVM model uses a kernel trick to transform the data and find an optimal boundary between classes. The performance of the SVM model is evaluated using training and testing accuracy, and confusion matrices are generated to visualize the classification results.

### Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are computing systems inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains. An ANN model in this project consists of multiple layers of interconnected neurons, which process the input data and learn patterns to classify handwritten digits. The model is trained using backpropagation to minimize the loss function. The performance of the ANN model is assessed based on its accuracy on the testing dataset.

### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are a class of deep neural networks, most commonly applied to analyzing visual imagery. In this project, a CNN model is designed to recognize and classify handwritten digits. The CNN architecture includes convolutional layers, pooling layers, and dense layers. The model leverages spatial hierarchies in data to learn complex patterns. The CNN model's performance is evaluated on the testing dataset, with accuracy metrics indicating its effectiveness.

## Usage

### Data Preparation

- **Loading Data**: The dataset for training and testing is loaded from CSV files. Each row in the CSV files represents an image of a handwritten digit.
- **Feature Extraction**: Features (pixels of the images) and labels (digits) are extracted from the data.
- **Data Standardization**: The data is standardized to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.

### Training and Evaluation

- **Model Training**: Each model (SVM, ANN, CNN) is trained on the standardized training data.
- **Model Prediction**: Predictions are made on both the training and testing datasets.
- **Performance Evaluation**: The models are evaluated based on accuracy and confusion matrices, which provide insights into the classification performance and misclassification rates.

## Results

The project includes detailed comparisons of the performances of SVM, ANN, and CNN models. Accuracy scores for both training and testing datasets are reported, along with confusion matrices to visualize the classification results. The results highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each model in recognizing handwritten digits.

### Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of different machine learning models for handwritten text recognition. By comparing SVM, ANN, and CNN, we gain insights into their effectiveness and potential use cases. The detailed evaluation helps in understanding the trade-offs between different models in terms of accuracy, complexity, and training time.
